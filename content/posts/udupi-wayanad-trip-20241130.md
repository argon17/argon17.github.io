It had been a long time since I went on a solo motorcycle ride.

All I needed was a good motorcycle trip — just me, the bike, and the open roads.

**My Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (sarcasm intended):**

- Self-fulfillment Needs → Motorcycling  
- Psychological Needs → Motorcycling  
- Basic Needs → Motorcycling  

Since my birthday was around the corner, I wanted this trip to be during my birthday week.

Kerala, also called God's Own Country, had been on my list for a long time, and this was my chance.  
I also added Udupi to my itinerary.

So, the plan was to ride to Udupi first, ride along the coastal roads to Wayanad, and finally return to Bengaluru.

I must say, this was a very well-planned trip. I booked my stays in advance. The forecast predicted rain, so I was prepared.  
And, I rented a Honda H’ness CB350 — perfect for the kind of adventure I had in mind.

With my luggage packed and strapped to the bike, I was all set!

### Day 1: Bengaluru to Udupi

**Route:** Bengaluru → Nelamangala → Hassan → Mudigere → Samse → Karkala → Udupi  

The day started with heavy rain. I didn't expect the rain as soon as I hit the road.  
It kept raining on and off throughout the day.

The highlight of the ride was the stretch through **Kudremukh National Forest**. The lush greenery and misty hills were a delight, even in the rain.

I reached my homestay around 6 PM.  
The owner was very welcoming and shared some must-visit spots around Udupi.  
However, I learned that a yellow alert had been issued in Wayanad due to the rain. I worried I might have to cancel my plans if it turned into a red alert.  

But for now, I decided to stick to my plan and went to bed after dinner.

### Day 2: Exploring Udupi

I started the day with a visit to **Malpe Beach** and took a ferry to **St. Mary’s Island**. The sandy shores, unique rock formations, and the calming sound of waves were absolutely peaceful.  

Later, I visited the **Hanging Bridge in Heroor**. The views from the bridge were scenic, and I even tried kayaking there for the first time.  

In the evening, I rode to **Maravanthe Beach**, where the road runs between the sea on one side and a river on the other.  

For dinner, I had a **Masala Dosa** and the delicious **Mini Gudbud Ice Cream** at **Woodlands Restaurant**.  

Checked the news, the rain was under control in wayanad and it was getting better. So, my plans were still on.

### Day 3: Birthday Ride to Wayanad

This was the day I was most excited about — a birthday ride into the heart of Kerala!

The stretch from **Malpe Beach to Mattu Beach** was stunning, with the road running right next to the sea. It felt perfect for my birthday.  
I rode along **Padubidri Beach**, **Surathkal**, **Mangalore**, **Panambur Beach**, and **Kasargod**, couldn't even realise I had entered into Kerala already.

It was the time for lunch. So, started searching for places to eat.
Finding vegetarian food in Kerala was a challenge, but I managed to get egg fried rice and pineapple juice at a small eatery in **Mattul**.

The ride through the **Thalassery** and **Mahe** was breathtaking, with beautiful views giving me the company.

However, it was late evening, and I was still about 120 km from Wayanad.
So, I skipped **Kozhikode** and took the shortest route to Wayanad via **Vatakara**.  

By 6:30 PM, I finally reached my stay in **Kalpetta, Wayanad**, covering around 430 km.  
I was tired but thrilled — a simple yet fulfilling birthday ride!

### Day 4: Exploring Wayanad

Wayanad was calm, peaceful, and full of natural beauty.  
My day began with visits to **Karapuzha Dam** and **Kanthanpara Waterfalls**.  

Then, I turned off my maps and rode through random countryside roads to explore freely.  

I wrapped up the day at **Banasura Sagar Dam** — the largest earth dam in India and the second largest in Asia. I took a motorboat ride there.  
The view of the vast reservoir with surrounding hills was the cherry on top of an amazing day.

### Day 5: Back to Bengaluru via Mysuru

On the way back, I rode through the **Bandipur Forest**.  
I took a breakfast break at **Vinayaka Mylari** in **Mysuru** for their legendary masala dosa.

By evening, I was back in Bengaluru, completing my 1500-km journey.  
This trip was exactly what I needed — a perfect mix of beaches, forests, and countryside roads.
