Go outside and get some air, Mom told<br>
she thinks, I'm depressed,<br>
I should meet new people<br>
talk to them, chill with them.<br><br>

How do I tell her that<br>
initiating conversation is a hard stuff for me,<br>
I'm afraid, I might say something wrong<br>
I feel secure while expressing myself on pages.<br>

Mom doesn’t know, that I’m always lost<br>
in my incredible imaginations,<br>
I don't want to be recognized socially<br>
but a little gesture of me existing would work.<br>

Although I like to<br>
open up to my close ones,<br>
They are few, who makes me speak<br>
They're the ones who never judge me.<br>

However, I shut down my laptop<br>
changed clothes, took my earphones,<br>
And started walking fast<br>
trying best to avoid eye contacts.<br>
