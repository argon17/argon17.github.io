Hey girl, look at you,<br>
what have you done to yourself?<br>
I remember the confidence you held,<br>
in those debates on international politics.<br><br>

those bright and charming eyes,<br>
I can't find them anymore.<br>
where is that carefree girl,<br>
full of dreams and aspirations?<br>

planning dinner for his guests?<br>
addressing a random fellow as *Papa*<br>
And your own parents’ home<br>
a stranger’s place it has been<br>

That individuality and the freedom<br>
seems to be lost somewhere,<br>
who is the culprit here,<br>
I often wonder.<br>
