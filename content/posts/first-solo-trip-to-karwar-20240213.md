I had taken a few days off from work â€” not because I was burnt out or had any plans, but simply because I needed a break. I believe in the mantra:
**"Rest while you can, not when you have to."** ðŸ˜‰

I set my status as *Out of Office* on Webex. That evening, my flatmate Ranjan called me and asked,
*"Kahin ghoomne jaa rahe ho kya? Tumhare Webex pe Out of Office dikh raha hai."*
(Are you going on a trip? Your Webex shows youâ€™re out of office.)

I told him I just wanted to rest for a few days.

But this call planted an idea in my mind. *Why not plan a bike trip instead of just sitting around?*

## Planning the Trip

- Booked an Airbnb in Karwar
- Rented an **XPulse** from Royal Brothers
- Planned my routes

I was all set!

## Early Mishaps and Beautiful Sceneries
By 8 AM, I already had 2 minor crashes, one with a lady on a scooty and the other with a diversion road blocker.
I guess they both were my faults as I was little distracted both the times. I got panicked after these two incidents.
I started riding more carefully. At that instant I even had a second thought of cancelling the plan and riding back to Bengaluru.
But, Glad that I didn't. While I was riding, there were a lot of beautiful sceneries along the way.
I think in general, nature has truly been kind to **North Karnataka**.
Also, The excitement kept increasing as the number of kilometres remaining on my screen was moving towards the double digits.

## Perfect Sunset Arrival at Karwar Beach
The entrance to Karwar was truly beautiful. It began with two successive tunnels in the hills. As soon as I passed through both the tunnels, I turned my head to the left and there it was - the **sea**!
This was my first-ever encounter with the sea. I couldn't believe I was riding right next to it. It was **6:03** PM and I had completed **541 kilometers** â€” the longest motorcycle ride of my life till date.

Even though it wasn't moving properly on the sand, I tried to get as close as I could. Oh man, what a beautiful view it was! I was already in Karwar, and I had arrived at the **Karwar beach** at the perfect time of sunset.

It felt like a victory. I took off my gloves and helmet and sat there, watching and listening to the waves until it got dark.
Finally, I rode to my homestay to rest.

## The Journey Back

The following morning, I had to leave for Bengaluru. My Airbnb host was extremely kind. She was quite surprised when I told her I came all the way from Bengaluru on a bike. While I was leaving her place in the early morning around 5, she prepared me a cup of coffee and wished me a safe journey.

While returning, I took a different route. Around 8 AM, after covering around 100 kilometers, I heard the sound of a nearby  river-stream.  I decided to go and explore it.
There was a clay home with a lot of banana trees around it. I saw one old lady there, she also had few calves and dogs. She spoke Kannada and didn't understand Hindi or English. But I guess, she understood why I'm here for and guided me the way to river.

And there what I witnessed was truly amazing. A peaceful river flowing between mountains under the gentle morning sun. I accidentally discovered this beautiful underrated hidden gem, No one was there, I was enjoying the view all by myself. I sat over there on a stone for almost an hour.

### Chitradurga Stay and Departure to Bengaluru

By afternoon, I had covered more than half the distance to Bengaluru. But the weather was not very nice, and I didnâ€™t feel like riding anymore. So, I decided to stay in **Chitradurga** that night.

The next morning, I visited the **Chitradurga Fort**. And after the breakfast, I checked out and left for Bengaluru.
