### About Me

Hello there, I'm Prem. I graduated with a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from NIT Patna in 2022.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Infineon Technologies.

Apart from programming, I enjoy going on motorcycle rides, expressing my thoughts through illustrations and poetries, and watching movies.
